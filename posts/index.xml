The last time I did this, I installed Android Studio because it seemed like the easiest way to get the Android SDK working. However, I never used it as an IDE, so it was hard to justify keeping it on my system since it takes up more than 30GB.
This time, with a year of Linux experience under my belt, I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to install and configure everything needed to build apps for Android without having to install Android Studio.</description></item><item><title>Chronicles Of My First Arch Installation</title><link>http://gbergatto.github.io/posts/chronicles-arch-installation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Apr 2023 12:11:48 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://gbergatto.github.io/posts/chronicles-arch-installation/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to start a blog for a couple of months now, but I kept putting it off it, not knowing what to write about at first. Last week I installed Arch Linux on my laptop, so I guess this is the right place to start.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what Arch Linux is, I&amp;rsquo;m glad to be the one to introduce it to you. You can read more about it here.</description></item></channel></rss>
